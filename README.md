# Ensuring Equality: Discrimination Reporting Form

### Written and Developed by Group P05

The *Ensuring Equality: Discrimination Reporting Form* is a user-friendly questionnaire-based website application. It has been created to assist in fast-tracking the legal consultative process, regarding disability and equal opportunity discrimination. 

It does this by allowing our client, Equality Lawyers, to understand the circumstances surrounding a potential claim prior to any client/lawyer interaction.

The questions asked and the responses given will ultimately paint an informative picture of a potential discriminatory scenario. This information will then generate a downloadable PDF which can be sent to a lawyer for review or downloaded for the user's own keeping.
