  ### **Welcome**
  
  Equality Lawyers’ Ensuring Equality: Discrimination Reporting Form is a questionnaire-based software application designed to help identify potential incidents of disability discrimination and provide assistance to people going forward.

  It is common for people who have been treated unfavourably because of their disability to be unsure as to whether their situation amounts to discrimination before the law. This reporting form will seek to clarify this uncertainty and assist them by connecting individuals with Equality Lawyers for legal help.

  Reflecting Australian and South Australian anti-discrimination laws designed to protect people with disabilities and their families from unfair treatment on the basis of their disability, the Ensuring Equality: Discrimination Reporting Form will ask users a set of questions to determine whether an incident of disability discrimination has occurred, and provide a variety of options for resolution.

  If you wish to access additional information regarding disability discrimination or other disability-focused legal issues visit our [services page](https://www.equalitylawyers.com.au/services).
