question: "Ensuring Equality: Discrimination Reporting Form"
subquestion: |
  ### **Welcome**
  
  > Equality Lawyers' *Ensuring Equality: Discrimination Reporting Form* is a questionnaire-based software application designed to identify potential incidents of disability discrimination and provide assistance to victims going forward. 
  
   It is common for people who have been treated unfavourably because of their disability to be unsure as to whether their situation amounts to discrimination before the law. This reporting form will seek to clarify this uncertainty and connect individuals with Equality Lawyers' advice.
  
  In accordance with the State and National laws designed to protect those with disabilities from unfair treatment, the *Ensuring Equality: Discrimination Reporting Form* will ask users a set of questions to determine whether an incident of disability discrimination has occurred, and provide a variety of options for resolution. 
  
  If you wish to access additional information regarding disability discrimination or other disability focused legal issues visit our [services page](https://www.equalitylawyers.com.au/services).
  
  If you wish to continue and complete the *Ensuring Equality: Discrimination Reporting Form* press **Continue**.
